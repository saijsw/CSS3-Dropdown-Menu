CSS3-Dropdown-Menu
==================

Pretty much exactly what the repo's name says. Features cursor proximity detection, fluid widths, potentially unlimited levels of subnavs, and CSS3 transitions, all without JavaScript (JS *is* used to smooth over some things for older browsers).

<b>History:</b><br />
The first build of this project was completed in May 2010; it started as a sort of self-appointed dare to see if it were possible to create a CSS-only dropdown menu with fluid widths and cursor detection (supplanting the need for "proximity testing" scripts - e.g., Suckerfish). After much caffeine and elbowgrease, I actually did it.

The subsequent transition-supporting build was completed somewhere in September 2011; it uses a polyfill (powered by jQuery) to add transitions for browsers that don't support them in CSS.

<b>Support:</b><br />
Neither of these menus are tested or supported in Internet Explorer 6, and quite frankly, I couldn't give a damn, either. Move on, people.

Slightly bulky and awkward in IE7, but fine on IE8+.

Naturally functions as smooth-as-silk on Firefox, Chromium, Opera, Safari, etc.
